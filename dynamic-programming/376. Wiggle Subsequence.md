A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

**Examples:**

```
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.

Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

**Follow up:**

Can you do it in O(n) time?

一个数列中如果相邻两个数的差值是正负数交替轮流出现，那么这个数列称作摆动数列，第一个差值可以是正数，也可以是负数（如果存在）。
一个小于两个数的数列也被称作摆动数列

举例来说，[1,7,4,9,2,5]是一个摆动数列，因为差值[6,-3,5,-7,3]是正负数交替轮流出现的，作为一个对比，[1,4,7,2,5]和[1,7,4,5,5]
不是摆动数列，因为前者的前两个差值都是正数，而后者的最后一个差值数是0

给出一个数列，返回最长摆动子数列的长度，一个子数列是通过删掉原来数列中的某些项，剩下的项保持顺序不变得到的

Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
